## Core Principles

### Code Quality

- All code must adhere to established coding standards and best practices.
- Code reviews are mandatory for all changes to ensure maintainability and readability.
- Documentation must accompany complex logic to aid future developers.
- Keep code simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.

**Rationale:** High-quality code reduces technical debt and ensures long-term project sustainability.

### Testing Standards

- Comprehensive test coverage is required for all new features and bug fixes.
- Tests must include unit, integration, and end-to-end levels where applicable.
- Automated testing pipelines must be maintained and run for every pull request.

**Rationale:** Rigorous testing ensures software reliability and minimizes the risk of regressions.

### User Experience Consistency

- Interfaces must be intuitive, accessible, and consistent across all platforms.
- User feedback must be incorporated into iterative design improvements.
- Adherence to established design guidelines is mandatory.

**Rationale:** A consistent user experience fosters trust and satisfaction among users.

### Performance Requirements

- Performance benchmarks must be defined and met for all critical operations.
- Regular profiling and optimization must be conducted to prevent bottlenecks.
- Resource usage must be monitored to ensure scalability.

**Rationale:** Optimal performance ensures the application remains responsive and scalable under load.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
